    - Parent Constructor

    - Child Render

    - Parent Did Mount

Sequence React life cycle with multiple children (2 children) 
    - Parent constructor

    - Child1 constructor 
    - Child1 Render
    - Child 2 constructor
    - Child 2 Render
    
    <DOM updated>

    - Child 1 Did mount

# Redux Toolkit (RTK)
    - Install Redux Tookit 
    - we have 2 libraries 
        1) reduxjs/toolkit
        2) react-redux
    - Build our Store 
    - Connect our store to our app
    - we will create a cart slice
    - We will dispatch an action.
    - Selector to read the new data
    
# Types of testing (developer testing)
    - Unit testing
        - Unit testing means testing a unit or a single component in an isolation.
        - Not testing the whole app, only testing a single component.
    - Integration testing 
        - Integration testing means testing multiple components which works involving each other.
    - End to end testing or e2e testing
        - Testing whole flow of the app
    
    - As a developer we concern majourly first 2 testing, i.e. Unit and Integration testing

# Libraries for testing
    - React Testing Library (RTL)
        - Most standard way to write test cases.
        - Many companies use this library
        - It is based on DOM Testing Library. RTL is wrapper on DOM Testing Library
    
    - JEST
        - RTL uses JEST behind the scenes.

# Setting up Testing in App
    - Installed RTL
    - Installed Jest 
    - Intalled Babel dependencies
    - Configure Babel
    - Config .parcelrc file to disable babel from Parcel
    - JEST Configuration (by using command = npx jest --init)
    - Install JSDOM library (You will find the documentation on RTL website)
